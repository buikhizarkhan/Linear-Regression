# Linear-Regression
In statistics, linear regression is a linear approach to modeling the relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables. The case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear regression.

I have develop a linear regression model with the dataset of real estate which includes 8 attributes.

I have overview the dataset with some of the techniques and graph-plots and find out the Corelaton between every independent and dependent variable and choose the highest corelation holding attribute.

Then I find out the slop and intercept values which will be using in the linear regression equation and then find out the equation.

I have also determine the R-Square value which was very good.
